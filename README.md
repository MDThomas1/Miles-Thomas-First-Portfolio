## Description
The beginnings of an industry protfolio containing an introduction, my contact details and some links to other work I've done.

## Installation
N/A

## Usage
The page is laid out so that you can get a sense of who I am through my photo and ‘About Me’ section and then immediately screenshots of webpages that I have developed. There is also an easy way to navigate the pages with links to any required information such as my contact details in the footer of the article. On top of that you can also click on the screenshots and be sent to the webpages themselves for a better look.
